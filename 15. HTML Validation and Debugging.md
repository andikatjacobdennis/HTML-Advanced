   - **Example**: To validate a webpage at `https://example.com`, you would enter this URL in the validator's input field.

2. **HTMLHint**
   - **URL**: [HTMLHint](https://htmlhint.com/)
   - **Usage**: Provides real-time feedback on HTML code quality and common mistakes.
   - **Example**: Paste your HTML code into the HTMLHint online editor or integrate it into your IDE.

3. **CodePen Validator**
   - **URL**: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
   - **Usage**: Offers HTML validation within the CodePen environment for instant feedback on your code.
   - **Example**: Create a new pen, and the editor will provide validation feedback on-the-fly.

### Example of Using W3C Validator

## 15.2 Common HTML Errors and Fixes

Here are some common HTML errors and how to fix them:

### Missing or Incorrectly Nested Tags

**Error**:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul></p>
```

**Fix**:
Ensure all tags are properly nested and closed. Hereâ€™s the corrected HTML:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

### Unclosed Tags

**Error**:
```html
<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph
  <p>This is another paragraph
```

**Fix**:
Make sure all tags are properly closed:
```html
<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph</p>
</div>
```

### Incorrect Attribute Usage

**Error**:
```html
<a href="https://example.com" target="new">Visit Example</a>
```

**Fix**:
Use the correct attribute value for opening a new tab:
```html
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
```

### Missing `alt` Attribute on Images

**Error**:
```html
<img src="image.jpg">
```

**Fix**:
Always include an `alt` attribute for accessibility:

```

### Checking Console for Errors
