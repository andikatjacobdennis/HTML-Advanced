### 11. Integrating JavaScript into HTML

#### 11.1 Inline JavaScript
- **Definition**: JavaScript code written directly within an HTML element's `onclick`, `onmouseover`, or other event attributes.
- **Example**: 
  ```html
  <button onclick="alert('Hello, World!')">Click Me</button>
  ```
- **Use Case**: Suitable for simple, one-off actions or testing, but not recommended for larger applications due to maintainability issues.

#### 11.2 Internal JavaScript
- **Definition**: JavaScript code included within the `<script>` tags directly inside the HTML document, typically within the `<head>` or before the closing `<body>` tag.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <script>
    function greet() {
      alert('Hello, World!');
    }
  </script>
  ```
- **Use Case**: Ideal for scripts that are only relevant to the current HTML page or for small projects where external files are unnecessary.

#### 11.3 External JavaScript
- **Definition**: JavaScript code written in separate `.js` files and linked to the HTML document via the `<script>` tag.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <script src="scripts.js"></script>
  ```
- **Use Case**: Best practice for larger applications, allowing code reuse, better organization, and separation of concerns.

#### 11.4 Asynchronous and Deferred JavaScript
- **Asynchronous Loading (`async`)**:
  - **Definition**: JavaScript files are loaded asynchronously, meaning the script is fetched in parallel to HTML parsing, and execution happens as soon as the file is downloaded.
  - **Example**:
    ```html
    <script src="scripts.js" async></script>
    ```
  - **Use Case**: Useful for scripts that donâ€™t depend on the DOM or other scripts, improving page load times.
  
- **Deferred Loading (`defer`)**:
  - **Definition**: JavaScript files are fetched in parallel but executed after the HTML document has been fully parsed.
  - **Example**:
    ```html
    <script src="scripts.js" defer></script>
    ```
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for scripts that rely on the DOM being fully loaded, ensuring smooth interaction.

#### 11.5 Embedding JavaScript in HTML5 Data Attributes
- **Definition**: Custom data attributes (e.g., `data-*`) in HTML5 can be used to store information within HTML elements, which JavaScript can later retrieve and manipulate.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <div id="myDiv" data-message="Hello, World!"></div>
  <script>
    const message = document.getElementById('myDiv').dataset.message;
    alert(message);
  </script>
  ```
- **Use Case**: Useful for passing dynamic data to JavaScript without altering the HTML structure, keeping content and behavior separate.
